# AR Knickknacks

## Description

This project was developed as part of the coursework for *CS 428 Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality* at the University of Illinois at Chicago during the Fall 2022 semester. The goal of the project was to create two Augmented Reality (AR) knickknacks featuring two different attractions: Chicago's Cloud Gate ("The Bean") and the United Center. Additionally, the application displays the local time and live weather information for these attractions.

Chicago, a city known for its iconic landmarks and sports culture, provided the inspiration for the chosen attractions. Cloud Gate, a famous public sculpture in Millennium Park, and the United Center, home to the Chicago Bulls, were selected as the focal points for the AR experience.
